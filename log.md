# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 25, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Started The Complete Web Developers Course on Udemy, Began to set up my free webhosting offered with the course, Chunky Monkey exercise Basic Algorithm Scripting freeCodecamp

**Thoughts:** Didn't realize I needed to set up a webhosting account before starting on the course so waiting on that. Luckily, it is included free for 1 year with the course. As far as my algorithm practice went, errrrr I am really struggling with them. I had to look up the answer so I decided this time around I would comment the explanation in while typing the code out within SubLime.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
