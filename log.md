# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 25, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Started The Complete Web Developers Course on Udemy, Began to set up my free webhosting offered with the course, Chunky Monkey exercise Basic Algorithm Scripting freeCodecamp

**Thoughts:** Didn't realize I needed to set up a webhosting account before starting on the course so waiting on that. Luckily, it is included free for 1 year with the course. As far as my algorithm practice went, errrrr I am really struggling with them. I had to look up the answer so I decided this time around I would comment the explanation in while typing the code out within SubLime.

### Day 1: April 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on 3 challenges with freeCodeCamp in the Basic Algorithm Scripting. Almost done with that section!

**Thoughts**: Boy do I feel like sometimes I am just not fully gasping this. My first challenge I figured out right away. The last 2 I had to see the answer then try to understand how it worked. I am currently trying to understand why === had a -1 behinf it.
